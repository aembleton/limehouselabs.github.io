Membership of Limehouse Labs is limited to a maximum of 25 members. New members will only be admitted by invitation from existing members, and every member has an anonymous veto over new members joining.

The membership fee is currently Â£30/month, payable by direct debit, although this may be reduced as membership grows. If you're concerned about the cost, we may be able to do you a deal.

We expect members to use the space at least every three months. If you are no longer active we may ask you to step aside to allow a new member to join.

If you're interested in joining, please turn up to one of our public open events and have a chat with one
an existing member.
