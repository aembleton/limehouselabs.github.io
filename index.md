Limehouse Labs is a small, friendly private hackspace based in [Limehouse Town Hall](https://www.limehousetownhall.co.uk/), East London, for people doing interesting things with hardware, software, craft and arts. 

Our space is modest but has enough room for a few people to work, as well a laser cutter, 3D printers, and all other small prototyping equipment.

Limehouse Labs aims to actively foster group projects, as well as being a workspace for personal tasks. We are linked to <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">Electromagnetic Field</a> and act as EMF's London base.
