Let’s keep this simple:

* We do not tolerate homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.
* We do not tolerate harassment, of any kind.
* Respect other people’s personal space. If they ask you to leave them alone, do so.
* Aggression and elitism are not welcome — nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

The directors can revoke membership immediately for breaching the Code of Conduct, or for any other reason, but we won’t do this arbitrarily.
